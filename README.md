# Word Wrapper Kata
This an excerpt from Uncle Bob's story about this Kata.
>"Yeah, it's a simple problem to understand, but it's oddly difficult to solve.  The basic premise is really simple.  You write a class called Wrapper, that has a single static function named wrap that takes two arguments, a string, and a column number.  The function returns the string, but with line breaks inserted at just the right places to make sure that no line is longer than the column number.  You try to break lines at word boundaries."

This is my attempt at this Kata.

If you want to do this Kata as well a good stating point is https://github.com/greyepoxy/TextWrapper/commit/e6f9a25216e644798a23173658b8597bb0ceae5d.
